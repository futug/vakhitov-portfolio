# Almaz Vakhitov Site-portfolio/cv

My friend is looking for a job as videomaker, and motion designer but he doesn't has opportunity to send the one link with examples of his work and CV to the employers.
Instead of this he was sending the pdf-cv and link to google disk.

So, i decided to help him, and create a web-app wich will reflect his work and strong sides.

## Technologies: Simple CRA with Css modules + i18next + FramerMotion.

The next stage of this project, after it'll be done ofc, is link it with one of the headless CMS like Strapi or Wordpress Headless, to let my friend implement changes and add new work-examples. For now it is a simple static landing page.

## Design

I didn't have any design when decided to create this app, so i went to behance and found this [Link REFERENCE](https://www.behance.net/gallery/172178533/Videomaker-Curitiba-Landing-Page?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cvideomaker) and tried to implement it with my changes.
